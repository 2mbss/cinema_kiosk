MOVIE POSTER IMAGES
===================

This folder should contain movie poster images that are uploaded through the admin system.

The movie selection page will automatically look for images in the main assets folder:
- Main location: /assets/images/ (shared with admin)
- Fallback: If image doesn't exist, shows placeholder

PLACEHOLDER IMAGE:
- Create a file named "placeholder-movie.jpg" 
- Recommended size: 300x450 pixels (movie poster ratio)
- Should be a generic "No Image Available" graphic

IMAGE REQUIREMENTS:
- Format: JPG, PNG, GIF
- Size: Under 2MB for fast loading
- Dimensions: 300x450 recommended (2:3 ratio)

The admin system manages all movie images, so this kiosk will automatically display whatever posters are uploaded there.
